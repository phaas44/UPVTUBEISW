# UPVTube Software Engineering Project
# Introduction 
This repository contains the project work conducted during my exchange semester in fall 2024 at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Valencia (UPV). In a group of three students, we leveraged the tools of Microsoft Azure DevOps. For our collaborative routines, we implemented an agile working procedure. My personal key learnings from that project were:
- [UML Class Diagram Modelling]
- [Usage of Microsoft Azure DevOps for organizing work in a group]
- [Implementing of SCRUM/agile methodologies]
- [Entity Framework]
- [Windows Forms for GUI]

# Task formulation
The task formulation was given as plain text. From this, we had to extract the UML Class Diagrams and the Use Cases. For interested readers, the task description can be found here.

# Future Work
So far, a functioning application that meets the given requirements has been provided. However, I want to push this project further and use the existing code base as a backend. The idea would be to connect this existing backend to a yet-to-be-developed frontend via an API.
